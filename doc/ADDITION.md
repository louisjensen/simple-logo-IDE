CompSci 308: SLogo Addition
===
Louis Jensen (lbj7)

# Before

### Estimation

 * How long do you think it will take you to complete this new feature?
 * * I plan to add the feature that will allow users
 to click on a turtle to change its image and I believe that 
 it will take me about an hour.


 * How many files will you need to add or update? Why?
 * * I think I will need to add one file for the turtle
 selection context menu and modify the currently existing 
 turtle context menu.


# After

### Review

 * How long did it take you to complete this new feature?

 * How many files did you need to add or update? Why?

 * Did you get it completely right on the first try? If not, why not?


### Analysis

 * What do you feel this exercise reveals about your project's design and documentation --- was it as good (or bad) as you remembered?

 * What about the design or documentation could be improved?

 * What would it have been like if you were not familiar with the code at all?
